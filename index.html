                            <h3>Presented by Pauline Narvas <a href="https://twitter.com/paulienuh">(@paulienuh)</a></h3>
                            <p>Being in an industry that technically doesn’t stop, we can all get caught up with chasing on what the next new shiny thing there is to learn or take part in. As someone who was keen and ambitious in “breaking through” the industry, I found myself thinly spread to a point that was unhealthy and potentially dangerous long-term. Burnout is real. In this talk, I’ll share experiences as well as tips on helping spot patterns that lead to burnout and how to deal with it before it gets out of hand.</p>

                            <p>You didn't get that cool programming job because you're a great programmer. You got it because the company you work for wants to make money and they think you can help. It's easy for us to feel like our worth/value/capitalist expression is tied to our employment, but it's also useful to flip that narrative and talk about how our companies need us, and how we can use that understanding to be more valuable employees and even better humans. </p>
                            <p>What is the value that you bring to your employer? Can you articulate it? Can you expand it? Can you take that value and use it for your own purposes?</p>
