                <dt>What are you doing to make this event accessible?</dt>
                <dd>The event will be live captioned and will be included in the stream. Post-event we will provide recordings and transcripts. Speakers are paid for their time.</dd>
                <dt>Can I submit a talk?</dt>
                <dd>Not this time. We are reaching out to folks who submitted excellent talks to our previous physical events but did not get chosen in the review process. We will still run a talk submission process at our physical events.</dd>
                <dt>What are the social sessions?</dt>
                <dd>We're still working it out, but we feel it's important to try and provide social networking opportunities as well as broadcast talks. Hang tight for info.</dd>
                <dt>How much does it cost to sponsor?</dt>
                <dd>We're asking for sponsorship to cover the cost of paying speakers, live captioning and printing/shipping stickers. We're looking for 4-5 Â£800 sponsors for which you'll get listed on this site and a 5 minute talk during the day. We'll also ship your stickers with ours and give you a discount on sponsoring our next physical events. If you're interested please <a href="mailto:kevin@yougotthis.io">get in touch</a>.</dd>
